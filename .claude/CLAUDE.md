# INSTRUCTIONS

## GENERAL

- Keep it concise, clear, and to the point
- If I ask for something that could be better done another way, suggest it. Always consider alternatives
- Use the Golang expert skill AS SOON as you understand you are working with Golang code

## CODE

- Do not add code comments for trivial things
- I want simple and KISS code, no over engineered bullshit

### GOLANG

- Use the gopls MCP's go_search to find code you are looking for
- Use the gopls MCP's go_diagnostics to find build errors
- Use the gopls MCP's go_symbol_references to find usages of symbols
- Prefer to use table-driven tests.
