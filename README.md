# Dotfiles

Arch Linux can be installed by my installation script found here on my [Github](https://github.com/ALX99/Arch-AI).  
The dotfiles here are meant for my own usage and uploaded for the sake of sharing. Grab anything you think is useful.  
Packages I use are found under [.pkgList](https://github.com/ALX99/dotfiles/blob/master/.pkgList) and are managed by my pacman/yay wrapper [paccy](https://github.com/ALX99/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/paccy).

_If the keybindings for some applications look weird it's because they are. I use Colemak-DH as a keyboard layout._
