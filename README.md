# Dotfiles

These dotfiles are primarily uploaded for personal backup & sync purposes, however 
you may discover useful aliases and scripts within as I tend to use the shell a lot.  
Here is a list of places which might be interesting to check out:

- [.profile](https://github.com/ALX99/dotfiles/blob/master/shell/.profile)
- [.bashrc](https://github.com/ALX99/dotfiles/blob/master/shell/.bashrc)
- [.aliasrc](https://github.com/ALX99/dotfiles/blob/master/shell/.aliasrc)
- [bin/](https://github.com/ALX99/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/bin)
