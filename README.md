# Dotfiles

Arch Linux can be installed by my installation script found here on my [Github](https://github.com/ALX99/Arch-AI).  
The dotfiles here are meant for my own usage and uploaded for the sake of sharing. If you for some reason would like to try them out run the `install` script after DWM is configured.
