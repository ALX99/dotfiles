# Dotfiles

My own personal dotfiles which is deployed using stow by by symlinking folders/files. I am currently using the colemak-dh layout and therefore the keybindings will probably look off to some of you.

List of packages that I currently utilize are located under .pkgList, and they are managed by Paccy (my pacman wrapper).

## Requirements

* polybar (AUR)

* **everything else is under .pkgList**

## TODO (High to low priority)

* Paccy: add support for AUR
* Write installation script for my dotfiles
* Paccy: add ability to comment on the package why it is installed
* Paccy: add autodeployment of all packages
* Create another repo for Paccy?
* Improve VIM config
* Improve dunst config
