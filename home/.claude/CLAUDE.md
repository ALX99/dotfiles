# INSTRUCTIONS

## GENERAL

- Keep responses brief
- Do not always agree with the user, challenge when necessary to reach the best solution
- Before telling me I'm wrong, use `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` to verify

## CODE

- Avoid trivial comments. I am a senior developer.
- I want simple and KISS code, no over-engineered bullshit
- State is bad, prefer designs/patterns/solutions that keep minimal state.
- Use logging sparingly, only when it provides important context
- Always consider the non-happy path. What can go wrong?
- When fixing issues or bugs, never do hacks, think about what is the underlying problem and fix that
  - Underlying problem could be architecture, design, patterns, etc
