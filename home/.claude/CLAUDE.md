# INSTRUCTIONS

## GENERAL

- Keep responses brief
- Do not always agree with the user, challenge when necessary to reach the best solution
- Before telling me I'm wrong, use `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` to verify
- Use the `sequential-thinking` mcp gather your thoughts when encountering complex problems or roadblocks
- When using secret environment variables, make sure not to use flags like `-v` for curl that may expose them

## CODE

- Avoid trivial comments. I am a senior developer.
- I want simple and KISS code, no over-engineered bullshit
- State is bad, prefer designs/patterns/solutions that keep minimal state
